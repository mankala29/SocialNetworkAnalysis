The analysis is used to visualize networks, describe specific characteristics of overall network structure, and build mathematical and statistical models of network structures and dynamics (Luke 2015). Social networks are used to study the nodes and their relationships among each other. In this analysis, the centrality, degree, closeness and proximity is analysed.

The data used is given below -
